			<h2 id="about-heading" class="about-heading">About Me</h2>
			<p class="about-sub">Hey! My name is <strong>Daniel Anorue Jr</strong>, a (Junior) Computer Science major at <strong>The University of Southern Mississippi</strong>.</p>
		</header>

		<article>
			<p class="about-p">
			I aim to specialize in <strong>Software Engineering (Full-Stack)</strong>. I take extracurricular classes in order to bolster my skillset toward becoming a decent Software Developer. 
			I’ve done courses with <span class="badge">IBM</span>, <span class="badge">FreeCodeCamp</span>, and <span class="badge">CodePath</span> to that effect.
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">
      		Career-wise, I haven’t yet secured an internship, co-op, or part-time job directly related to software engineering, but I’m consistently improving my skills. 
			My closest experience was helping my cousin’s startup build their website, where I learned about collaborative development and core web fundamentals.	
			Although, I have (and still currently am) worked part-time in other industries — as a technician, a fry cook, a caterer, and an events management crew member — in common, these jobs taught me a lot about how to work with customers and as a team member.
			Most importantly, I learned how important I am as an individual cog in the company machinery, and how my role contributes to keeping operations running smoothly — and how small errors and lapses could lead to the “machine getting faulty.” 
			These lessons and job-specific skills I have gained have helped me navigate not just the job market but life in general. I apply some of these fundamentals to my school life, and they have made me a more responsible person.
			
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">
			As for projects, my biggest motivation is to work on something impactful to other people. I hoped to do that in an internship where there is already an established infrastructure (funding, user base, and all that), but I haven’t been fortunate to get one yet. 
			However, that hasn’t stopped me from embarking on small projects here and there to test my skills, like my social media site <span class="project-links"><a href="#TOL">ThinkOutLoud</a></span> and my brewery locator <span class="project-links"><a href="#RB">Rum Barrel</a></span>. 
			This previous summer, I decided to do something on a bigger scale — an application tracker with some social media capabilities (being able to add friends and share opportunities on the site). It’s called <span class="project-links"><a href="https://internin.onrender.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InternIn</a></span>. 
			This is by far my favorite project, and I’ve devoted so much time to it. I try to make updates whenever I get time from school. I actively use it and maybe I might advertise it more when it’s polished.
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">
			I try to be involved as much as I can. Having been a member of several notable campus groups like <strong>NSBE</strong> and <strong>Google Developer Groups</strong>, I decided to challenge myself by starting my own <span class="project-links"><a href="https://colorstack.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ColorStack</a></span> chapter here at Southern Miss. 
			My aim is to build a supportive community for minority tech majors so as to help them feel confident in their journey through college. We are just starting, but I think it has the potential to become a great investment because USM desperately needed something like this.
			</p>

			<p class="hobbies">
			In my free time, I love playing video games, basketball, going for walks, or watching anime. (Fun fact: a majority of my life skills are from video games!)
			</p><br>

			<p class="about-p">
				I am open to connecting and making friends and possibly collabortaing in projects, but most importantly — I Am Open To Work!
